ask Manager/Planner (To Do List Project in React) is a simple and user-friendly web application that allows users to manage their tasks and to-do lists efficiently. With this intuitive tool, users can add new tasks, mark existing tasks as completed or incomplete, and remove tasks when they are finished.

Key Features


Add Tasks: Easily Users can add new tasks to their to-do list by entering the task name and clicking the '+' button, ensuring their task list stays up-to-date and organized.

Complete/Uncomplete Tasks: With just one click, users can mark their tasks as completed or uncompleted, making it easy to track which tasks have been accomplished and which ones are still pending.
